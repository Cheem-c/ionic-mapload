  Reported deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) have increased steadily in the past two decades
      throughout the Greater Washington metropolitan area. Virginiaâ€™s statewide records show a 10-
      fold increase during the last 40 years with a 300 percent increase since 1984. Statewide in
      Maryland, the number increased by more than 150 percent from 1,505 in 1990 to 3,849 in 2003.
      In Montgomery County, MD accidents have more than doubled since 1993 from less than 900 to
      about 2,000 in 2004. In the city of Washington, reported DVCs in Rock Creek Park increased
      over 200 percent between 1994 and 2004.
